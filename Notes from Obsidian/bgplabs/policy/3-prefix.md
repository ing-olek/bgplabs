## Actions & Discussion
Discuss topics:
- It is best practice always configure inbound and outbound route-maps to double-protect your AS from wrong routes
- Scenario: 
	- You have AS-Path access-list on "out", but you still advertise some wrong routes (/32 from loopbacks) to ISPs
	- If AS-Path access-list is not pre-configured, configure it again.
