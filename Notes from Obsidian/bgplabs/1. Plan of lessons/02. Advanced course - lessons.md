In my opinion it makes sense to do BGP labs in the following sequence.

# Advanced course

## Advanced BGP use cases
- basic/8-aggregate - Aggregate in BGP prefixes redistributed from OSPF 
- policy/4-reduce - Accept only default + ISP's local routes from ISPs
- basic/e-ebgp-multihop - Use eBGP-multihop session through firewall
- policy/9-community-use - Use BGP communities
- policy/d-no-export - Use well-known BGP community "NO_EXPORT" to protect from being transit ISP
- policy/a-locpref-route-map - Manipulate LocalPref in more complex scenario
- policy/f-orf - Apply ORF (Outbound Route Filtering) in cooperation with ISP to save CPU and bandwidth of your router
## Use iBGP in large networks
- ibgp/2-transit
- ibgp/3-rr
## BGP session and policy templates
- session/6-templates
- session/7-policy
## AS-Path manipulation in BGP
- session/1-allowas_in
- session/2-asoverride
- session/3-localas
- session/4-removeprivate
- session/5-routeserver
## Load balancing in BGP
- lb/1-ebgp
- lb/2-dmz-bw
- lb/3-ibgp
- lb/4-ibgp-add-path
## Other BGP features
- session/8-passive
- session/9-dynamic
- basic/d-interface - configure IPv4 BGP session over IPv6 LLA (link-local addresses), using "interface" instead of IP in `neighbor` command
- policy/e-wedgies - Interesting case, when using only BGP community might not work (but works together with AS-prepends). Also it's the case when state of BGP depends on sequence of events in the past
