In my opinion it makes sense to do BGP labs in the following sequence.
# Basic BGP configuration
Configuring eBGP sessions with multiple ISPs, receiving and advertising routes:
- basic/0-frrouting - FRR with clab must be used instead of Cumulus in WSL
- basic/1-session
- basic/2-multihomed
- basic/3-originate
- basic/5-redistribute
# Basic routing policies
## Inbound and outbound route filters
Protect from being transit AS with AS-path access-list and inbound and outbound route-maps:
### Outbound filtering
- policy/2-stop-transit
- policy/3-prefix
### Inbound filtering
- basic/b-max-prefix/
# Securing & optimizing BGP session
Configure MD5 password, TTL security and TCP AO to protect BGP session.
- basic/6-protect/ - Arista vEOS with libvirt must be used in WSL
- basic/9-ao/ - Arista vEOS with libvirt must be used in WSL
- basic/7-bfd - Configure BFD and optimize BGP timers
# Use iBGP
- ibgp/1-edge/ - use 2 edge BGP routers
# Configure routing policy
Now let's define routing policy for outbound and inbound traffic.
## Outbound traffic policy
Manipulate BGP weight and LocalPref for outbound traffic policy.
- policy/1-weights/
- policy/5-local-preference/
## Inbound traffic policy
In the previous labs we set preferred links and ISPs for outbound traffic, it was pretty straightforward.

Prefer one link or ISP over another for inbound traffic is more challenging. Obviously, because our inbound traffic is outbound for peers / ISP and they have their routing policy set with LocalPref, weight, etc.!

However, there are few common techniques in BGP to manipulate inbound traffic.

Manipulate BGP AS-Path and MED and other ways for inbound traffic policy.
- policy/7-prepend/
- policy/6-med/
- policy/8-community-attach/
- policy/b-disaggregate/

# BGP routing in large networks
# Advanced routing policies

- policy/4-reduce
- policy/d-no-export/
- policy/f-orf/
- policy/e-wedgies/
- policy/9-community-use/
- policy/a-locpref-route-map/
- session/7-policy/
# Advanced BGP session configuration

# BGP for IPv6
Configure BGP session for IPv6 routing (dual-stack):
- basic/4-ipv6/
- basic/d-interface/

# AS-Path manipulation in BGP

# Load balancing in BGP
