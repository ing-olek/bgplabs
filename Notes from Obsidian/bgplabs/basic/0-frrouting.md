# Summary
[Configuring Cumulus Linux and FRRouting Â« BGP Labs](https://bgplabs.net/basic/0-frrouting/) 
Try **netlab**.
## Lab customization
Cumulux Linux doesn't work in WSL, therefore it is replaced with FRR.

Another workaround is change provider from **clab** to **libvirt**. Then **vagrant** will automatically download image of Cumulux Linux and deploy VMs.
## Actions & Discussion
Check if FRR process is running with `ps -ef | grep frr` command.

# My notes
## Cumulux Linux doesn't work in WSL in clab
The lab uses Cumulus Linux in containerlab with docker image networkop/cx4.4.0 - it doesn't work in WSL. But it works on my Ubuntu laptop.

```

Therefore I'll replace `cumulus` with `frr` in `topology.yml` file and also updated text message.
```

## Running Cumulus Linux with libvirt & vagrant
Set **libvirt** as default provider in `topology.yml` file.
