# Summary
[Advertise Default Route in BGP Â« BGP Labs](https://bgplabs.net/basic/c-default-route/)
Advertise default route to BGP.
## Lab customization
No. FRR image is used, it works in WSL.
## Actions & Discussion
In this lab `x1` represents customer router and `r1` is ISP router (usually they are vice versa). 
The goal of the lab is to advertise only default route to customers (because Internet "Full view" with > 900 000 prefixes is too much for small customer router).

Let's check what routes `x1` receives at start. It receives 192.168.42.0/24 prefix, which represents all Internet routes.

Let's advertise default route to `x1` from `r1`. In some OS you may have default in routing table to advertise it in BGP, or you may have to use command like `default-originate always`. 
In BGP we configure `default-originate` on per-neighbor basis (in contrast with OSPF).

Now we see customer router receives default. But it still receives all other routes (represented by 192.168.42.0/24).

Let's filter other routes!

Now customer receives only default route. The task is done!
